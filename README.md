Book of Shadows
====

The story goes that the older a programmer gets, the less he or she wants to learn. For shame! The day I stop 
learning is the day I've died. This is a collection of various utilities with a purpose very similar to the 
book from which it takes its name. This Book of Shadows represents some of the rituals and knowledge of 
a programmer that never stops learning. In that regard, it is my hope that some are able to learn from the 
source contained herein.
